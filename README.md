# Uoa Library Site Reimplementation
This project is a redesign of the site of [UOA libary](http://www.lib.uoa.gr/) for the Human-Machine communication lesson. This
implementation emphasizes on design. Thus, the site isn`t fully functional. It is based on a heuristic evaluation according to [Nielsen's 
principles](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and the mockups designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
